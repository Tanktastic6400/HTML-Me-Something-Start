        <h1>Kingdom Hearts 2 <br> May Your Heart Be Your Guiding Key.</h1>

        <p>Sequel to Kingdom Hearts, a game produced and made by square enix in conjunction with Disney.
            You play as a young boy named Sora, who through no fault of his own leaves his home of Destiny
            Islands and goes on an adventure with his new friends Donald and Goofy, through various Disney worlds,
            in search of his old friends Rikku and Kairi from Destiny Islands.
        </p>

        <p> Along the way you fly through space on a Gummi Ship (trademark pending), team up with Disney stars
            like Mulan, Captain Jack Sparrow from Pirates of the Caribbean, and even Jack Skellington from Nightmare
            Before Christmas.
            You fight evil, save some people and discover the power of friendship.

        <p>After playing the original Kingdom Hearts on a whim back when it first released, finding out that it had a
            sequel
            absolutely blew my little 11 year old mind. I remember the hours I would spend on Kingdom Hearts One. Now as
            an adult,
            without a single doubt in my mind, KH2 is forever a staple as one of my favorite all time games. Bigger
            maps, more
            convoluted and confusing storyline, more combat mechanics. I remember freaking out the first time combat
            forms were
            introduced into the series, I would spend hours trying to figure out how the Rage form worked. I only wish
            that I
            could experience it for the first time again. Oh, let's not forget about the reaction commands. It basically
            took
            you from the normal combat into an action scene/ sequence that was so cool compared to normal combat, I only
            ever replayed
            the game for those scenes alone.
