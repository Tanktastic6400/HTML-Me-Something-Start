        <h1>Bioshock<br>Would you kindly keep reading?</h1>
        <p>
            Have you ever wondered what an isolated post-apocalyptic city would look like if it 
            was 2000 leagues below the sea and also doubled as your worst nightmare?  Look no further 
            than at the city of Rapture.  A city that was designed to be an isolated utopia, quickly 
            ran into problems when ADAM was discovered, this was refined into a serum that gave people 
            superhuman-like powers.  This utopia didn’t last however, soon wealth disparages caused an 
            all out war to start.  People went insane, killed each other and the property value went down tremendously.

            I don’t remember why I tried Bioshock, I do remember being scared out of my pants when I played the 
            demo which was essentially the first 10 minutes of the game.  What I think really stands out about 
            the game is that it didn’t pull any punches like games I had played up to that point.  It was dark, 
            it was gritty, it was immersive in its horror.  It really helped show what kind of dark art styles 
            I enjoy.  Also the story was just fantastic, it really keeps you guessing and as someone who doesn’t 
            fall for plot twists easily, it really kept me guessing about what was going to happen next.  Is lower 
            on the list, because even on easy the game is quite difficult, the “plasmid” powers you get are not the
             most intuitive mechanics, and you're usually hurting for ammo throughout the whole game from what I 
             remember.  Also while I like the horror aspect of the game, I don’t generally like horror. I just liked this game.
