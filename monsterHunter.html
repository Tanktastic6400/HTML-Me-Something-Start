            This is what I like to call a grind fest game.  You start off with equipment, kill monsters to unlock more weapons and armor,
             and then go kill bigger and cooler monsters as you go.  I started with Monster Hunter Rise, but I actually like World maybe 
             a tad bit more for the artstyle and difficulty.

            I got into this game recently and has quickly shot up in my rankings for favorite games.  I gave it number two because while I 
            do love the series so far, it doesn’t exactly WOW you with anything in particular.  The weapons feel good for the most part, 
            with all of them having steep learning curves to use effectively, adding to the difficulty.  The monster designs are some of my
            favorites, although I don’t care for dinosaurs, having some monsters that have unique biology, habits and habitats really speaks 
            to my wildlife lover side.  The thing I love the most about Monster Hunter is the fact that it really makes you think about
            HUNTING the monster instead of killing it.  It may just be the inner nerd in me, but to be an effective hunter you have to know
            what you're hunting, what it’s strong against, what it’s weak against, what kind of items you should use and when.  At a certain
            point, once you have learned and gotten used to the various mechanics and controls you really get immersed into the game and 
            that's what I love about it.
