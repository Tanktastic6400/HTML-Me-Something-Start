        <h1>Okami <br>Origin of all that is good, and mother to us all.</h1>
        <p>A PS2 game that has you play as Amaterasu which is the utmost highest deity in Shintoism. The game is a
            retelling of most of the major events in Shintoism.
            You fight through hordes of various enemies, using your celestial mirror and Celestial Brush techniques. The
            game literally determines the types of attacks by
            drawing on the screen in-game and depending on what and how you draw, determines what attack and how the
            attack is affected. An example of this is drawing a
            circle with a dash in it creates a Cherry Bomb, but depending on how big or small of a circle you draw
            depends on how close or further away from the screen the
            bomb is when it’s created.

        <p>This game is probably my most favorite game when it comes to combat, unique game mechanics, and overall aesthetic.
            The game featured a watercolor style graphics to it, which while sometimes annoying, really fit the overall theme
            of the game being an ancient story about how Ammy (Amaterasu) was able to overcome evil and bring peace to the land.
            The celestial brush techniques were also some of the most unique game mechanics that came out at that time.  The
            fact that the game came out in 2006 for the PS2 really speaks to how innovative that really is. The major issues
            with the game is that it plays so much like a children’s storybook, meaning the amount of explaining and hand
            holding that the game does really feels like Capcom thought either children or adults with really low IQ’s would
            be playing it and would need the mechanics re-explained every 5 minutes. After an hour of replaying it you get
            so annoyed you just want to quit playing, because the other curse of PS2 games is that they rarely made cutscenes
            skippable. I think the gameplay really holds up well, but for as much as it holds up, I think it also gets in
            its own way. Worth a first time play through but not really good for replayability unless you are one that doesn’t
            get annoyed easily.
